# Hi there! I'm Facu 👋

I'm a 🧠 Software Engineer, 🎨 UX/UI Designer, and 💻 Frontend Developer specialized in React. I build fluid and scalable products with a strong focus on design, usability, and functionality.

🚀 I'm currently working at **[Bitlogic](https://www.bitlogic.io/)**, building digital solutions for the Student Platform of **[Universidad Siglo 21](https://21.edu.ar/).**

🧪 On the side, I'm developing **[whatMLmodel](https://whatmlmodel.vercel.app/)** — a tool that uses AI to recommend machine learning models based on your problem.

📚 I’m learning about **machine learning and artificial intelligence**, aiming to create smarter, more user-centered experiences.

💡 My approach to design and development is pragmatic: creativity is just the beginning — clear thinking and problem-solving drive every decision.
